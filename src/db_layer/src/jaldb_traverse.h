/**
 * Utility function to iterate over the records in a DB in order by timestamp.
 *
 * This function iterates over the database in timestamp order. Operations performed
 * on each record are dictated by the return value of the callback. Only timestamps
 * which fulfill <tt> start_time <= current_time <= end_time </tt> are examined. Timestamps are
 * never negative numbers.
 *
 * If the return from \p cb is JALDB_ITER_CONT, continue processing, but do not 
 * modify the current record.
 *
 * If the return from \p cb is JALDB_ITER_REMOVE, remove the current record,
 * and continue processing.
 *
 * Any other return value causes processing to halt, the current record is not
 * removed, and control is returned to the caller.
 *
 * @param[in] ctx The DB context to use.
 * @param[in] type The type of record to delete.
 * @param[in] timestamp The beginning of the range to traverse (SID as hex
 * string). This may be \p NULL, in which case the value of zero is used.
 * @param[in] cb The user specified callback.
 * @param[in] up A pointer value that is passed un-modified to \p cb as the \p up
 * parameter.
 *
 * @return JALDB_OK on success, or an error.
