.TH JAL_PURGE 8
.SH NAME
.B jal_purge
\- 
.SM JALoP
database purge utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jal_purge
[\fIOPTION\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page describes the
.BR jal_purge
command.
.PP
The
.B jal_purge
utility removes records from a JAL database. Without any options, the
.B jal_purge
tool reports the number of records of each type that would be removed,
but does not purge any records.
Only records that have been sent to at least one JALoP Network Store are considered safe for removal.

Note that the tool does not stop removing records when it finds a record that was never sent to a JALoP Network Store,
it will skip the unsent record and continue.
For example,
consider a database that contains records with the sequence numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,
where records 1, 3, and 5 have been delivered to at least one JALoP Network Store.
A call to
.B jal_purge
with no arguments would report that it is prepared to delete records 1, 3, and 5,
leaving records 2 and 4 untouched.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sid=S\fR
Remove all records up to and including the record with serial ID \fB'S'\fR. '-t' must also be specified.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-uuid=U\fR
Remove all records up to and including the record with UUID \fB'U'\fR.  By default, this checks the serial ID to determine what records came before. '-t' must also be specified.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-type=T\fR
Search within the specified type.
\fBT\fR may be the letter \fIj\fR (for journal records),
\fIa\fR (for audit records),
\fIl\fR (for log records).
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-before=B\fR
Remove all records with a timestamp before \fBB\fR.
The timestamp must be specified as an XML schema date, time or dateTime string.
The xmlschema-2 document (http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/) describes these formats.
When the time does not include a timezone offset,
it is interpreted as local time.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-delete\fR
Delete the records.
The
.B jal_purge
tool does not remove records that the JALoP Network Store has not sent to at least one JALoP Network Store.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
When \fB\-\-delete\fR (\fB\-d\fR) is given,
force the deletion of records even when the JALoP Network Store has not sent them to at least one JALoP Network Store.
When given without \fB\-\-delete\fR (\fB\-d\fR) this will report the number of records that would be deleted.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Report more information about the records \fB jal_purge \fR is prepared to delete.
This reports the sequence ID and UUID of each record.
Records are grouped by type.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-home=P\fR
Specify the root of the JALoP database, defaults to
.I /var/lib/jalop/db
