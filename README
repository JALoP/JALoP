This a reference implementation of Journal, Audit, and Logging Protocol (JALoP).
The implementation is divided into a number of sections.
  The JALoP Network Library (JNL)
  The JALoP Producer Library (JPL)
  JALoP Local Store
  JALoP Network Stores

Building
This project uses the scons (www.scons.org) build tool and will compile under python 2.4 or 2.6. Later version of Python should work as well, but were not tested. You do not need to install scons to build, a version of scons is included as part of the distribution. To build, simply run the scons script in the top directory:

$ scons
This generates debug, and release directories.

To build the and execute the unit tests, run
$ scons tests

To generate code coverage reports, run
$ scons cov
code coverage reports will appear in the 'cov' directory in the root of the
source tree.

To generate doxygen documentation, run
$ scons doc
The generated documents will appear in the directory doc/doxygen.out

To clean the build output you can simply run
$ scons -c

Scons accepts a '-j' argument for parallel builds, so

$ scons -j6 
will run 6 worker threads in parallel.


The build environment honors a number of variables, these are:
CFLAGS - a set of flags to use when compiling C source files. To enable flags
for both C and C++, use the CCFLAGS environment variable.
CCFLAGS - a set of flags to use when compiling C and C++ source files.
CXXFLAGS - a set of flags to use when compiling C++ source fils.
LDFLAGS - a set of flags to pass to the linker
CC The C compiler to use
CXX The C++ compiler to use
LD The linker to use
CPP The C preprocessor to use


All of the source code for the implementation is under the 'src' directory. The src directory is divided into different sections based on functionality, subdirs such as network_lib, local_store, etc.

A number of patches for external project are included. These patches are modify existing projects (e.g. log4cxx) to utilize JALoP as an output method. These may be found under the 'patches' directory.

This project is built and tested in the following environments:
  RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 on x86_64, using gcc version 4.1.2
  RHEL 6 on x86_64, using gcc version 4.4.4
  RHEL 6 on i386, using gcc version 4.4.4
  Solaris 10 TX 09/10 on i386, using gcc version 3.4.3

Additional Notes for Solaris
This project requires GNU awk to build and expects the 'awk' found on the path to be GNU awk. If this is not the case, you will need to install GNU awk either from source (http://www.gnu.org/s/gawk/), Sunfree (http://www.sunfreeware.com). You may also need to modify the 'PATH' enivronment variable to get scons to see the right version, i.e.:

$> PATH=/path/to/awk:$PATH scons tests
