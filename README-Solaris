Notes:

The following are notes on what was required in order to build and install the
source packages.

    A number of applications require gcc 3.4.6.

    xerces:
	http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi

	./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib"
        Compiled and installed using make.

    axl:
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/vortexlibrary/files/

	./configure CFLAGS="__EXTENSIONS__"
        In src/axl_log.c, getpid() must be casted as an int.  A patch has been
	supplied.
        Compiled and installed using gmake

    vortex:
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/vortexlibrary/files/

	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig"
        ./configure CFLAGS="-lsocket" --disable-py-vortex
        Compiled and installed using gmake.

    santuario:
	http://santuario.apache.org/download.html

	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/ssl/lib/pkgconfig"
        ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/ssl/lib -R/usr/local/ssl/lib"
        Compiled and installed using make.

    libconfig:
        http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/

	./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib"
        Compiled and installed using make.

    xqilla:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/xqilla/files/

	./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib"
	Compiled and installed using make.

    dbxml:
	http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/downloads/index.html

	The included versions of XQilla and xerces-c were removed from the package
	and the build script was pointed to the local installations of those
	packages.

	./buildall.sh --prefix=/usr/local --build-one=berkeleydb
	./buildall.sh --prefix=/usr/local --build-one=dbxml \
					--with-xqilla-prefix=/usr/local \
					--with-xerces-prefix=/usr/local \
					--with-berkeleydb-prefix=/usr/local
