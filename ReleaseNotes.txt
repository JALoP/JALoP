    - Shutdown jal-local-store upon issues with database e.g. corrupt database.
    - Fix NULL deref in jalp_context_create(). If jal_calloc() fails, then a NULL context would be derefenced when setting the value of socket.

Summary of release 2.0.0.2-beta changes (Thu Sep 10 22:33:44 2020 -0400) -

    - (jls) Added flow-control (number of simultaneous connections) to jal-local-store.
    - (jls) Move setup_signals() call to the beginning of main() in jal-local-store for better handling of SIGTERM.
    - (jald) Added fflush(stdout) to force print out the jald.cpp config items at the launch instead of at the end.
    - (jal_purge) Fixed jal_purge not exiting gracefully on SIGTERM.

    - (jal_purge) Create a list of records to be purged and then remove them instead of re-initiating the query after removing each record.
    - (jal-local-store) Do not delete jal.socket created by a previous instance.
    - (jal_purge) Return non-zero on error.
    - (jal_purge) Check if db_root exists and is a directory or return error.
    - (jaln_context) Replaced the defined *INIT* and *MAX* threads passed to APR thread call by apr_size_t variables.
    - (jald) Added a sleep(1) between jaln_context_destroy() and jaln_context_create().
    - (jald) Disconnect all sessions for a subscriber when one j/a/l session fails so the peer can reconnect afresh.
    - (jal_purge) Mark the records as "Deleted' or 'Kept' in the report of 'jal_purge' as appropriate.

Summary of release 2.0.0.1-beta changes (Tue Apr 14 14:55:48 2020 -0400) -

    - Publisher auto-reconnects after a lost Subscriber comes back up.

    - Added --compact (-c) option to jal_purge for actually running a compaction on databases and return empty pages to the file-system. This should reduce the file-system usage growth. Compaction is an expensive operation and should be run when the database is idle or less busy e.g. when the system is in maintenance.

    - Updated jaldb_tail utils and man page. Option --data (-d) was added to display specific parts of the JAL records e.g. "a" for application metadata, "s" for system metadata, "p" for the payload (raw journal, audit, or log data), or "i" for record ID (UUID-Timestamp) only.
